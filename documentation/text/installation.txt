Installation
************

Important:

  Please ensure you have Python 3 plus the required modules as defined
  in the Requirements section.

Note:

  This was developed under Python 3.8 but may work on earlier
  versions, but has not been tested. It is unlikely to work in
  versions prior to 3.6.

Important:

  Mac users will need the xcode command line utilities installed to
  use pip3, etc. If you need to install these use the command:

     $ xcode-select --install


Installing Python
=================

You can install the latest version of Python 3.x by downloading the
appropriate installer for your system from python.org.

Note:

  If you are running MacOS Catalina Python 3 comes pre-installed.
  Previous versions only come with Python 2.x by default and you will
  therefore need to install Python 3 as above or via Homebrew, Ports,
  etc.By default the python command points to Python 2.x, you can
  check this using the command:

     $ python -V

  To specifically run Python 3, use the command:

     $ python3

Note:

  If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to
  have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an
  option (it’s normally off by default).


Installing "bloxone"
====================

1. Intall bloxone as local package

"bloxone" has been provided as an installable package using pip.

In your appropriate python3 environment you can therefore install
"bloxone" using the pip command. For example:

   pip3 install dist/bloxone-<version>-py3-none-any.whl --user

   or

   pip3 install dist/bloxone-<version>.tar.gz --user

Note:

  Use of pip ensures module dependencies and allows for uninstallation
  and upgrades to be handled cleanly.


Uninstalling "bloxone"
======================

You can use pip to unintsall the library. For example:

   pip3 uninstall bloxone
