============
Introduction
============

The Infoblox BloxOne suite of applications provides a RESTful API that is
published using Swagger on https://csp.infoblox.com/apidoc along with other
Infoblox APIs.

This module aims to provide a class hierarchy to simplify access to these
published APIs, performing the 'heavy lifting' whilst providing full access to
to their functionality. This is achieved by providing simple wrappers that enable
you to take the swagger documented object paths, fields and where appropriate 
JSON body from the documentation and pass them to simple get, create, delete and
update methods. These methods simply return a *requests* response object.

In addition, useful utility methods are provided for common tasks such as 
getting an object id, by defining the object key and value match pair. This is
combined with several (currently) undocumented API calls.

Some basic configuration, such a base url, API version and API key are read
from an ini file. An example of which is provided. When instantiating/initialising
this will read config.ini by default. Alternatively a path can be provided.
